General Planning - No Psuedocode


goal:

16x16 grid with adjustability up to 64x64 minimum
options and a rainbow mode


ui:

simple header with the title
footer with github & twitter
16x16 grid container on the ride side as shown in mockup.txt
controls on the left side with good spacing to not be awkward


features to implement:

dark/light mode
moving background
unique design
rainbow mode
sliders or on-screen ways to change block preference


things to learn:

making the 16x16 using JavaScript
more extensive use of DOM Manipulation
rainbow mode
semantic HTML


personal improvement goals:

better understanding of functions in JavaScript
code that is understandable without comments
semantic HTML to ensure good future habits, i've started to become a div troll
watch some videos about psuedocode to get a better understanding for future projects
less usage of display:flex when not required, general understanding of flexbox
