HTML:
-------------------------------------------------

header- stores 2 divs, titlecard & homepage(future projects will lead to a portfolio 22' page)
    homepage: contains 1 button that covers the whole div to ensure accessibility, class = header-button

main- 2 center divs to split the page in two, class = container
    controls: clear grid button, change size slider/button, rainbow mode button
    etch: further research required, just seperate to the side for now

footer- 2 buttons that link to twitter and github
    github: links to respective site
    twitter: links to respective site    

switched to CSS process.


CSS:
-------------------------------------------------
header- 
    looked up how to make using flexbox since its been a minute
    determined that a background color on the HTML instead of white would make the UI fit modern conventions
    looked up a good palette
    forgot to link my stylesheet... linked js sheet too
    don't like how it looks so far, but keeping it going and will do further UI once layout is done
    can't seem to get my footer to set at the bottom... respective
    fixed.
    done for tonight, god bless future me for looking at this code.
    finished the background and following.
